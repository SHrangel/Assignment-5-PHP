        <h2>Audience Review</h2>
        <p>Nory R: I give this a 9 out of 10! No matter if it's this version or the cartoon, I will ALWAYS shed a few tears when Mufasa dies :(</p>
        <p>Emily H: I would definitely recommend! I watch this with my kitty cat and I think it's safe to say that he too would highly rate this Disney movie!</p>
        <p>Lezdley P: Meh, I love the cartoon but seeing this kind of freaked me out... 6 out of 10.</p>
        
        <h2>Critics Review</h2>
        <p>Kristen B: The Lion King is a beautiful film with stunning effects. The cinematography has visuals that make you feel like you are in Mufasaâ€™s kingdom experiencing the adventures of Simba right alongside him.</p>
        <p>Matthew C: While the remake does result in being an admirable visual-effects experiment, it still plays things too safe in terms of story structure.</p>
        <p>Lynette N: The 'Lion King' is engaging, cinematically beautiful, and showcases some of the rich cultural traditions of Africa. Though at times, the CGI was a little distracting.</p>
